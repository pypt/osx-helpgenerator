		Tags are what identifies a page. Any page can have more than one tag,
		and the same tag can appear in more than one page. 
		
		Links are specified as tags, so if you want to directly link to
		a certain page, make sure it's the only page using that tag.
		
		Having the same tag on more than one page is useful for index 
		purposes. E.g., tag all pages related to printing as 'printing'
		and make an index entry that points to the tag 'printing'.
		You'll get a nice page that lists all pages having 'printing'.
		
		A few tags are fixed, such as 'access' for the access page, plus 
		'xa' through 'xz' and 'xall' for the index pages.

		The title of that page. May appear on other pages as well,

		Links to pages that are related to this page. Related pages

		The content of this help page. You can use simple HTML such as
		<p> for paragraphs, <b> for bold, <i> for italics, <img> for
		images and <ul>/<li> for lists. Special tags are:
		
		<link href=""> for an internal link to the help page
			having the specified tag
			
		<taskbox title=""> for a bordered, titled box. See
			problems.xml for an example.
